# OpenAPI Setup

It seems the OpenAPI specification file `/api-reference/openapi.json` referenced in your `mint.json` configuration could not be found. Here's how to resolve this:

1. Make sure your OpenAPI specification file exists at the correct path:
   - The file should be located at `/api-reference/openapi.json`
   - Create this file if it doesn't exist

2. Verify your mint.json configuration:
   ```json
   {
     // ... other config
     "openapi": "/api-reference/openapi.json"
     // or in the anchors/tabs array
   }
   ```

3. If your OpenAPI specification is in a different location:
   - Either move it to `/api-reference/openapi.json`
   - Or update the path in your `mint.json` to match your file's actual location
