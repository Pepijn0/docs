~~That's it! You will be presented with a unique URL that you can send to your customer.~~

*~~The URL will expire within 7 days~~*

#### ~~API~~

~~Kariz also offers the ability to programmatically generate Magic Link URLs via API.~~

~~To do this, make a POST request to the ~~[~~/link-token~~](https://docs.merge.dev/hris/link-token/)~~ endpoint.~~

~~In the body parameters of your POST request, set the ~~~~`should_create_magic_link_url`~~~~ parameter to ~~~~`true`~~~~.~~

~~`link_expiry_mins`~~

~~In your POST request, we recommend setting the ~~~~`link_expiry_mins`~~~~ body parameter to the maximum of ~~~~`10080`~~~~ so that the Magic Link URL expires after 7 days.~~

~~The generated Magic Link URL will expire 1 hour after creation.~~

### ~~Accessing Account Tokens for Linked Accounts Created with Magic Link~~
