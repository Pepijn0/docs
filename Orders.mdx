### Intro (check)

To interact with your users' orders, use the following configurations to fetch their orders. The order data from different channels is matched to a unified data model based on the Shopify order data model. For more details, refer to the Shopify Order API Documentation.

### Why Use the Shopify Data Model? (check)

Kariz uses the Shopify data model because it allows easy adaptation to your internal data model, especially if you have already built an integration with Shopify. You can instantly add new integrations since the data model is consistent across all channels.

### Modifications to the Shopify Data Model (check)

* **ID Fields as Strings**: All ID fields are converted to strings to maintain consistency across platforms.

* **Added `channel_name` Variable**: A new variable called `channel_name` indicates the source platform of the order data. For example, if the order data is fetched from Shopify, `channel_name = 'shopify'`.
