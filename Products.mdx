description: "Get all product data from connected E-commerce channels, including variants and inventory"
---

The product data from different channels is matched to a unified data model based on the Shopify product data model. For more information, refer to the[ Shopify Product API Documentation.](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest)

### Why Use the Shopify Product Data Model?

Kariz uses the Shopify product data model because it supports seamless integration with other e-commerce platforms. This consistency enables easier internal model adaptation, especially if you have already built a Shopify integration.

### Inventory Data Integration

The unified product data model includes inventory details for all product variants. With one API call, you receive:

* All products

* All product variants

* Their inventory

* Inventory levels split across multiple locations (if applicable)

For more details on inventory models, refer to the Shopify Inventory API Documentation:

* **Inventory Item**: [InventoryItem API Documentation]()

* **Inventory Level**: [InventoryLevel API Documentation]()

### Modifications to the Shopify Product Data Model

* **ID Fields as Strings**: All ID fields are converted to strings to maintain cross-platform consistency.

* **Added `channel_name` Variable**: Indicates the source platform of product data. For example, if data comes from Shopify, `channel_name = 'shopify'`.

### Supported Channels and Parameters

#### **Shopify**

* **~~`baseUrl`~~**~~ ~~~~*(string, required if unauthenticated)*~~~~: Shop URL (e.g., ~~~~`shop_name.myshopify.com`~~~~)~~

* **~~`token`~~**~~ ~~~~*(string, required if unauthenticated)*~~~~: OAuth 2.0 token~~

**Sample JSON:**

```json
{
  "params": {
    "shopify": [
      { "key": "baseUrl", "value": "shop_name.myshopify.com" },
      { "key": "token", "value": "oauth token" }
    ]
  }
}
```



By using these configurations, you can retrieve product details and inventory efficiently from various e-commerce platforms while maintaining a unified data model.
