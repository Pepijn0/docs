Kariz supports 2 types of authentication: Magic Link and token authentication. Using the Magic Link is recommended to get started.

## Get an Access Token

Before being able to make any request, you will need to create an Access token. This token is used to authenticate all of your requests to the Kariz API. By default, the token is valid for 90 days.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Endpoint
POST https://sts.demo.trykariz.com/connect/token
```
</CodeGroup>

Save this access token securely - you'll use it for all your API requests by including it in the Authorization header:

```text
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

## Magic Link Authentication

Our Magic Link is the component that your users will interact with in order to link their accounts to Kariz and allow you to access their accounts via the Kariz API.

<Note>
The Magic Link will handle credential validation, OAuth, and error handling for each platform that we support. Link works across all modern browsers and platforms.
</Note>

Magic links are created through the API with the Create a Magic link endpoint. With this call, an authentication link for the user is generated.

### Required Inputs

1. **Authorization**: Your Kariz Access token (not your application API key) must be included in the Authorization header for all API requests. This token is obtained from the Obtain Access Token endpoint as described in the Quickstart guide.
2. **tpUserId**: The user ID of the user. This user ID will be used to get user data across channels in subsequent requests.
3. **scopes** (optional): These are the sales channels that you want to let the user authenticate to. By default, the user will be given the option to authenticate to all supported channels.

You can generate a Magic Link for the same user multiple times. This allows the user to authenticate to additional channels with each request. Only the last credential entered for the authentication will be stored.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Endpoint
GET https://api.trykariz.com/api/KarizClientApp/GetTpUserAuthDisposableToken
```

```bash Headers
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

```bash Parameters
tpUserId=customer123@example.com (required)
redirectUrl=https://your-app.com/callback (optional)
scopes=shopify,amazon,woocommerce,bol,sharetribe,lightspeed_c,mirakl,magento,bigcommerce (optional)
```

```json Response
{
  "uri": "https://www.app.trykariz.com/en/tpuser/authorize?token=Mvznqqrm...AuD639OMo%3D",
  "token": "Mvznqqrm...AuD639OMo%3D",
  "expirationUtcUnixTimeSeconds": 1736269316
}
```

<Note>
When you send a tpUserId that doesn't exist yet, we create a new user record. When you use an existing tpUserId, we update that record to include new sales channels or update existing ones.
</Note>

## Token Authentication

If you already have authentication tokens for your users' E-commerce platforms, you can use Token Authentication to directly access their data without requiring them to go through the Magic Link flow.

When making API requests, include the token information directly in the request body:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Endpoint
POST https://api.trykariz.com/api/KarizClientApp/Unified/Products
```

```bash Headers
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

```bash Parameters
channel=shopify (required)
tpUserId=customer123@example.com (required)
```

```json Request Body
{
  "params": {
    "shopify": [
      {
        "key": "baseUrl",
        "value": "your-shop.myshopify.com"
      },
      {
        "key": "token",
        "value": "your-shopify-oauth-token"
      }
    ]
  },
  "limit": 10
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Channel-Specific Parameters

Different E-commerce platforms require different token parameters. These parameters need to be appended to each request for which you want to do the token authenticaiton:
