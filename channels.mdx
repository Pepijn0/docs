## Mirakl Marketplace Support

Kariz supports over 30 e-commerce marketplace integrations through Mirakl Connect. This extends our reach to many large marketplaces built on the Mirakl platform, including:

- Best Buy
- Decathlon
- MediaMarkt
- Nordstrom
- And many more

If your customers operate on niche marketplaces, there's a high chance they can connect through Mirakl. After completing the authentication process for Mirakl, you can access data from all their Mirakl marketplaces using the same unified data format you use for other platforms like Shopify.

<Note>
All Mirakl marketplace integrations are currently labeled as `Beta`.
