---

To make setting up an integration to Kariz as easy as possible, we use the same data models as the Shopify REST API Version 2024/07. See here for more details:

This is done to allow you to reuse your existing connector to Shopify. So the setup process to connect to new channels should only take a few hours if you already have a shopify integration.

Furthermore, we simplified the API structure with our GET all product info. These endpoints return all of the product and product related information. This includes products, variants, inventory and inventory location and allows you to fetch all this data across different channels.

The same goes for the GET all order info endpoint. This returns the order information, shipments, fullfillment and refund info all in 1 call. Making sure you have access to all the possible order information without needing to setup calls to multiple endpoints.


### Execeptions

By default, we return all of the data that is available from the E-commerce platforms. When they don't support some functionality, we leave it out of the response. For example, some channels don't include the inventory location information.

Here is an overview of the exceptions by channel
1. Shopify (none)
2. WooCommerce (No inventory location by default, store user needs to install this add on to enable it: https://wordpress.org/plugins/stock-locations-for-woocommerce/)
3. BigCommerce: (none)
4. Lightspeed (none)
5. Amazon (none)
6. Bol (none)
7. Mirakl (none)
8. Lightspeed (none)
9. Magento (none)
