# Data Models

To make setting up an integration to Kariz as easy as possible, we use the same data models as the Shopify REST API Version 2025/04. This is done to allow you to reuse your existing connector to Shopify. The setup process to connect to new channels should only take a few hours if you already have a Shopify integration.

## Simplified API Structure

We've simplified the API structure to allow you to fetch all the product & order information in a single call:

- For **products**, this includes products, variants, inventory and inventory location across different channels.
- For **orders**, this returns the order information, shipments, fulfillment and refund info all in one call.

This approach ensures you have access to all possible data without needing to set up calls to multiple endpoints.

## Exceptions

By default, we return all of the data that is available from the E-commerce platforms. When a platform doesn't support some functionality, we simply leave it out of the response. For example, some channels don't include inventory location information.

Here is an overview of the exceptions by channel:

| Channel | Exceptions |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Shopify | None |
| WooCommerce | No inventory location [user needs to install this add-on](https://wordpress.org/plugins/stock-locations-for-woocommerce/) |
| BigCommerce | None |
| Lightspeed | None |
| Amazon | None |
| Bol | None |
| Mirakl | None |
| Magento | None |

## Product Data

The unified product data model includes inventory details for all product variants. With one API call, you receive:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Products" icon="shirt">
    Core product details including title, description, and options
  </Card>
  <Card title="Product Variants" icon="palette">
    All variations of each product with their specific attributes
  </Card>
  <Card title="Inventory" icon="warehouse">
    Current stock levels for each product variant
  </Card>
  <Card title="Inventory Levels by Location" icon="location-dot">
    Stock levels broken down by physical location (if applicable)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
