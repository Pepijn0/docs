# Welcome to Kariz

You've come to the right place to learn how Kariz can help you build E-commerce integrations faster and more reliably. Our unified API approach lets you connect once and instantly access multiple sales channels.

## What is Kariz?

Kariz offers unified APIs for E-commerce. We allow our customers to build a single integration to Kariz and instantly launch all E-commerce sales channel integrations to their customers.

We do this by standardizing the data models across all the E-commerce platforms we support and allowing you to interact with the unified models using a set of clearly defined endpoints.

This way, getting product data from an E-commerce platform like **Shopify** will look the same as getting product data from other E-commerce channels like **Amazon** or **WooCommerce**. It's the same set of data models and fields you can rely on.

## Unified APIs

When scaling your E-commerce operation to multiple sales platforms, the effort and time spent both to build and maintain these integrations grows exponentially with the number of added channels. With Kariz, you don't have to worry about the complexity of the Sales Channels. You will receive data in the same format for every tool you choose to support.

We offer comprehensive tooling to make this process as simple as possible for any use-case you may have:

- **Multiple authentication methods** for flexible integration
- **Consistent data models** based on Shopify's structure
- **Simplified API calls** that return complete related data in one request
- **Smart pagination** for handling large datasets
- **OpenAPI schemas** for code generation and testing

## Our Data Models

To make connecting to Kariz as easy as possible, we use the same data models for our unified API as Shopify. This means that if you already have an integration to Shopify, we allow you to get set up in under an hour with all the other sales channel integrations that we offer.

We've also improved the experience by returning more complete data with fewer API calls:

- Our product endpoints include variants, inventory and inventory location data
- Our order endpoints return order information, shipments, fulfillment and refund info all in one call
