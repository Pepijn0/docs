Every call to a Kariz API must include an API secret key. After you create an Kariz Account, we will generate this API key. It has to be included in every request that you send to us so we can authenticate you.

## What you will built

If you haven't already, book a demo with us to get your account credentials. Here you will receive your **application** **API key**, every time you want to connect to connect to Kariz, this needs to be included in your request to our API.&#x20;

## Step 1: Create a developer account

If you haven't already, book a demo with us to get your account credentials. Here you will receive your **application** **API key**, every time you want to connect to connect to Kariz, this needs to be included in your request to our API.&#x20;

## Step 2: Authenticate a user

There are 2 ways to authenticate a user in Kariz. Using our generic authenticator or using token authentication. The second is recommended for testing with existing users or if you want to keep your style for the integration page. For more information on the different authentication methods click here. For this tutorial we will use our generic authenticator as this is the quickest way to setup.

To create a authentication link for users, with our generic authenticator, you need to send us 3 parameters:

* Application API key

* Sales channel(s)

* User name&#x20;

The application API key you received from us before, you need to send it in every request to us so we authenticate your requests.

The Sales channel(s) you send in the requests to us will determine what your end user will be asked to authenticate with. This can be one channel (shopify) but it can also be multiple channels at the same time (Shopify, WooCommerce and Amazon).

The username, in order to authenticate a user for you, we need to know how to call the user. This code will be used later to retrieve data for a client. When you send us a username in a request, that didn't exisit yet. We are creating a new user for you in our database. When you send us a username that already existed in ourdatabase, we will update that record to include new sales channels or update old ones.

## Step 3: Request data

Now that you have autenticated a user, you can request data from them on the different sales channels. The data will always be returned in exactly the same format. To try this out, we recommend retrieving order data. More detailed instructurions can be found here:

## Complete

Now you can integrate to any of the E-commerce channels Kariz is connected to. There are some important concept you may want to check out. Particularly, how we handle rate limits and pagination. Kariz has build in pagination for every connected channel. This makes it possible to request get large data files.

### Edit and preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with
    your docs content. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview changes">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally. 1. Install the
    [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    documentation changes locally with this command: `npm i -g mintlify`
    2\. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
    `mint.json` is): `mintlify dev`
  </Accordion>

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
    Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
    don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
    your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
    successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
    of the repo.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
    [Commit and push your changes to
    Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
    for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
    the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
    update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
