title: 'Rate Limiting'
---

Kariz unified API endpoints pass requests directly to their respective platforms and will be subject to each platform's unique rate limits.

For enterprise plans, there is also the option to use cached data instead. In this case, you will not experience the normal rate limits imposed by a specific platform (e.g. Amazon or Big Commerce). The rate limits for the read endpoints are 500 requests in a window of 10 seconds, per organization.
