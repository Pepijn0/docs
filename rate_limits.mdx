description: 'Understanding rate limits when using the Kariz API'
---

Rate limiting controls how many API requests can be made within a specific time period. Understanding these limits will help you optimize your integration with our unified API.

## Platform-Specific Rate Limits

When using Kariz's unified API endpoints, your requests are passed directly to their respective e-commerce platforms. As a result, these requests are subject to each platform's unique rate limiting policies:

| Platform | Typical Rate Limits |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| Shopify | 2 requests/second |
| Amazon |  1-5 requests/second |
| WooCommerce | Depends on hosting (typically 5-25 requests/minute) |
| BigCommerce | 150-450 requests/30 seconds (varies by plan) |
| Magento | Self-hosted, depends on server configuration |

<Note>
When building your integration, consider implementing exponential backoff and retry logic to handle potential rate limit errors gracefully.
</Note>

## Enterprise Cached Data Option

For enterprise plans, Kariz offers a cached data option that provides significantly higher throughput:

<Card>
**Enterprise Cached Data Limits:**
- 500 requests per 10-second window
- Per organization basis
- Available for all read endpoints
- No dependency on platform-specific limits
</Card>

This cached approach allows you to bypass the normal rate limits imposed by specific platforms like Amazon or BigCommerce, making it ideal for high-volume use cases or when you need more consistent performance.
